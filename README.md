# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Minions!
From the first version of my game you could only type in a repsonce. Now you have images to click on! AND......you are pitted against the minions! Listen to the banter when you win or lose rounds. Battle the minions!

--If your display is quite small and items appear disorganized, my apologies. I'm still practicing with CSS positioning.--
FYI, my 5 year old played the game on my touch screen laptop. He loved it!
